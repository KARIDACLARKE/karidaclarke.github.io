<p class="lead">Zhiane, a fierce demon bounty huntress with death and loss in her past as well, is close to achieving her ultimate goal and then settling into retirement.

        <p class="lead">Samuel, a Phoenix Warrior who monitors otherworldly interactions in the human realm, is eager to return to business as usual after his recent rebirth. Immersing himself in technology has always been enough before, but something seems to be missing now.</p>

        <p class="lead">Hadia, a young Mauritanian woman, was rescued from a life of enslavement by her mentor, the Desert Witch. Together, the women have the task of guarding the Eye of the Sahara, a portal to other realms. When the portal begins showing signs of failing, the Desert Witch sends Hadia on a search for help.</p>

        <p class="lead">Hadia has met Phoenix Warriors before, but nothing could have prepared her for Samuel and the threat he may pose to her freedom. Samuel communicates better with computers than people, but his desire for Hadia makes him uncertain whether to trust logic or instinct.</p>

        <p class="lead">Can they restore the portal before the realm is overrun by evil?  Or will their feelings compromise the safety of all humanity?</p>

        <p class="lead">
          Karida Clarke is a romance writer with a penchant for anything otherworldly. If it has scales, fur, poisoned talons, throws fire or casts magic spells, it might find its way into her stories. Karida likes her heroines multifaceted and her males swoon-worthy, Alpha-style. She believes that relationships matter more than things and places. In her free time, Karida enjoys lacing up for long runs and cooking ethnic cuisine. Pet peeves include Saran Wrap and people who don’t put their shopping carts away. She lives with her nerd-tastic husband and two spunky kids in Ohio.
